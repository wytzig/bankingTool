# Banking tool
This tool can be used to process csv files from the ASN BANK.
The ASN BANK is an eco-friendly bank that is online only and therefore has
some interesting options. One of these options is to download a CSV file
of previous transactions, giving you full control over your past expenses. 

## Goals
The goal of this tool is to explore those options offered by the bank. It aims at providing 
an interface to group and collect expenses and show neat graphs of them to the user.

## Setup
  - The project must have an 'output/' folder in which the program can save plot
images
  - The project *can* have a 'resources/' folder for input files

both of these files are ignored in the .gitignore
