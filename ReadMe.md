# Banking tool
This tool can be used to process csv files from the ASN BANK.
The ASN BANK is an eco-friendly bank that is online only and therefore has
some interesting options. One of these options is to download a CSV file
of previous transactions, giving you full control over your past expenses. 

## Setup
  - The project must have an 'output/' folder in which the program can save plot
images
  - The project *can* have a 'resources/' folder for input files

both of these files are ignored in the .gitignore
